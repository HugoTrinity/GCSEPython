#Constants explained.

#Constants look a bit like variables.

#But constants are declared in full capitals.

#For example....


THREEPOINT_SHOT = 3

FREE_THROW = 1


#When programmers see a constant.

#It tells them not to change the value.

#To display the value in the constant, the code is....


print(THREEPOINT_SHOT)
