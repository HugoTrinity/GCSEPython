String = "Bob123!"


#It is possible to do maths with floats and integers.

#It is NOT possible to do maths with strings or characters.

#Example:

num1 = 5    #Integer
num2 = 5.5  #Float
total = num1 + num2
print(total)

num1 = "5"    #Character
num2 = "5.5"  #String
total = num1 + num2
print(total)


#You cannot add strings or characters

#Instead, the add symbol glues them together.

#But we don't call it glue, we call it concatenation.
